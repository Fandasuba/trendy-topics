# trendy-topics

Having orignally worked with Socket IO for a Northcoders final project, i decided to take the spiking session i did and recreate a chat room style application using Socket.IO. INstead of using bais html and express to get the server running, I have dedcided to add in TypeScript, React, Tailwind and Next.JS to make it a more ambitious and modern tech stacks.

The general idea behind the app is that it is an Omegle style chat room, connecting you to a room with a user randomly. The subject ofd the conversation however is based on trending topics around the world using the unnofficial Google Trends API. This gives people the chance to talk abour trending topics, based on nationality, breaking news, the daily conversation and other such events. Expect a lot of football, politics, and any major weather reports.



## Getting started

If you wish to run the application, simply fork the git repo, and then run npm i. This will give you the basic framework to get the app to run. You can then use npm run dev to get a prodcution build of the app up. I also intend on hosting the app at somepoint using some free hosting software, like through Vercel since it comes with Next.JS anyway.
