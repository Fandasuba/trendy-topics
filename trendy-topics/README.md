# trendy-topics

Having orignal worked with Socket IO for a Northcoders final project, i decided to take the spiking session i did and recreate a chat room style application using Socket.IO. INstead of using bais html and express to get the server running, I have dedcided to add in TypeScript, React, Tailwind and Next.JS to make it a more ambitious and modern tech stacks.

The general idea behind the app is that it is an Omegle style chat room, connecting you to a room with a user randomly. The subject ofd the conversation however is based on trending topics around the world using the unnofficial Google Trends API. This gives people the chance to talk abour trending topics, based on nationality, breaking news, the daily conversation and other such events. Expect a lot of football, politics, and any major weather reports.

### Testing

Ignore this. Quick test for Git Hub issues???

## Getting started

If you wish to run the application, simply fork the git repo, and then run npm i. This will give you the basic framework to get the app to run. You can then use npm run dev to get a prodcution build of the app up. I also intend on hosting the app at somepoint using some free hosting software, like through Vercel since it comes with Next.JS anyway.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
